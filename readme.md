This application allows a passenger to book a car with the pickup and drop off address. It uses Google MAPs Distance matrix API to get the accurate distance. With this distance and type of fleet, airport toll, it calculates the fare. It shows the different fleet with different fare. Once passenger pays and books a car, he gets payment confirmation via email. At the same time, driver and business owner get the email with trip details. Each user has their own dashboard to see the trip details. Laravel5.5, jQuery and bootstrap 4 were used to develop this application.
